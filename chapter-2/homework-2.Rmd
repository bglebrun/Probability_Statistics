### Problem 2.1.8
A company audit showed that of all bills that were sent out, 71% of them were paid on time, 18% were paid up to 30 days late, 9% were paid between 31 and 90 days late, and 2% remained unpaid after 90 days. One bill is selected at random.

1. What is the probability that the bill was paid on time?
2. What is the probability that the bill was paid late?

#### Solution

\( P(risk) = 71/100 \)

1. 0.71

\( P(risk) = 29/100 \)

2. 0.29

### Problem 2.1.12
Let V be the event that a computer contains a virus, and let W be the event that a computer contains a worm. Suppose P(V) = 0.15, P(W) = 0.05, and P(V ∪ W) = 0.17. 

1. Find the probability that the computer contains both a virus and a worm.
2. Find the probability that the computer contains neither a virus nor a worm.
3. Find the probability that the computer contains a virus but not a worm

#### Solution

\( P(V \cap W) = P(V) + P(W) - P(V \cup W) \)

```{R}
# 1
0.15+0.5-0.17
```

\( P(V^C \cap W^C) = P(V \cup W)^C ) \)

```{R}
# 2
1 - 0.17 
```

\( P(V \cap W^C) = P(V) - P(V cap W) \)

```{R}
# 3
0.15 - 0.03
```

### Problem 2.1.14
 Six hundred paving stones were examined for cracks, and 15 were found to be cracked. The same 600 stones were then examined for discoloration, and 27 were found to be discolored. A total of 562 stones were neither cracked nor discolored. One of the 600 stones is selected at random. 

1. Find the probability that it is cracked, discolored, or both.
2. Find the probability that it is both cracked and discolored.
3. Find the probability that it is cracked but not discolored.

#### Solution

\( = \frac{k(all flaws)}{N(sample size)} \)

```{R}
# 1
562/600
```

\( = \frac{k(cracked) + k(discolored) - k(neither) }{N(sample size)} \)


```{R}
# 2
(15 + 27 - 38)/600
```

\( = \frac{k(cracked) - k(discolored)}{N(sample size)} \)


```{R}
# 3
(15 - 4)/600
```

```

### Problem 2.3.2
Let A and B be events with P(A) = 0.5 and P(A∩Bc) = 0.4. For what value of P(B) will A and B be independent?

#### Solution

P(A∩B) = P(A) - P(A∩B) = 0.5 - 0.4 = 0.1
P(B) = P(A∩B)/(P(A)) = 0.1 / 0.5 = 0.2

### Problem 2.3.6
The article “Integrating Risk Assessment and Life Cycle Assessment: A Case Study of Insulation” (Y. Nishioka, J. Levy, et al., Risk Analysis, 2002: 1003–1017) estimates that 5.6% of a certain population has asthma, and that an asthmatic has probability 0.027 of suffering an asthma attack on a given day. A person is chosen at random from this population. What is the probability that this person has an asthma attack on that day?

#### Solution

\( P(A) = 0.056 \)

\( P(B|A) = 0.027 \)

\( P(A_c) = 1 - P(A) = 0.944 \)

\( P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A_c)P(A_c) \)

```{R}
0.027*0.056 + 0
```

2. Given that Thomas scores more than 175, the probability that Sarah scores higher than Thomas is 0.3. Find the probability that Thomas scores more than 175 and Sarah scores higher than Thomas.

#### Solution

\( P(Sarah) * P(Thomas) \)

```{R}
# 1
0.4*0.2
```

\( P(Sarah_{Thomas 175}) * P(Thomas) \)

```{R}

#### Solution

1. \(p_x(x) = \sum_{y}p(x,y) \)

\(0.12+0.07+0.05+0.03=0.27\) for y=1

\(0.11+0.05+0.04+0.02=0.22\) for y=2

\(0.1+0.04+0.02+0.01=0.17\) for y=3
